# MKS22X-Magic
Monday, May 6
  Michael:
    Added basic balls in a variety of sizes and colors.
  Amanda:
    I made the balls bounce off of walls and the speed of the balls are dependent on size where larger balls are slower.
Tuesday, May 7
  Amanda: I made a subclass of ball with a new way of moving.
